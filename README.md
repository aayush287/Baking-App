# Baking-App
This app is a part of Android Nanodegree Project from udacity.<br>
This app show recipes to user. It uses __ExoPlayer__ to show recipes instruction.
## Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning<br>
the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide,<br>
it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App. 
## What I Learn?

In this project I learn:

   -Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
   -Handle error cases in Android.
   -Add a widget to your app experience.
   -Leverage a third-party library in your app.
   -Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
